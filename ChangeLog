* Fixed GUI to respect Y_MAX_POLYPHONY.

20120903 smbolton

* Luke Andrew added three new filter modes: 2-pole high-pass, 4-pole
    high-pass, and band-reject (plus he did some nice code
    refactoring.)

20120729 smbolton

* Removed all code enabled by '--enable-developer', except for the
    option to write patch files as 'C' code.  Under-development
    functions are now contained in git branches.

* Promoted Wavecycle Chorus to regular (non-developer-only)
    oscillator mode. 

* Promoted resonz to regular (non-developer-only) filter mode.

* Fixed a click that occurred with several oscillator modes (Wave
    Cycle, PADsynth, and FM) when using portamento in a monophonic
    mode, due to the oscillator phase being reset spuriously.

* Added icon (32x32 only for now, not installing).

* Added some new patches to the default set, including several
    contributed by Ken Restivo.

* Fixed configure.ac for FreeBSD (thanks, downstream.)

* Removed developer-only filters resonr (unneeded) and Neosweep
    (unremarkable; license unclear). Removed ESQ-1 patch import
    code, which never really worked anyway.

20100922 smbolton

* Added minBLEP oscillator waveform: clipped saw (thanks to Gordon
    JC Pearce for the inspiration).

* Added effect: Sean Costello's reverbsc from Csound.

* Added a few new patches to the default set, including a
    contribution from Idiomdrottning.

* Cleaned up effect common memory allocation and dirty buffer
    silencing (somewhat).

* Use new cairo-rendered knobs, when cairo is available (requires
    GTK+ >= 2.8; old knobs will be used if < 2.8 is found).

* Seriously: two consecutive copies of an inlined function that are
    not in cache can take longer to execute than two subroutine
    calls to the function's non-inlined version.  Re-thought
    WhySynth inlining.

* Debastardization of the GUI combo boxes (or, the death of
    popmenu).

* Reworked the minBLEP code for more even processor usage over
    successive process cycles.

* Consolidated some voice buffers for better cache utilization.

* On Mac OS X only (since it doesn't have a working mlockall()),
    added code at startup to page each wavetable into memory (and
    thus hopefully minimize page faults later.)

* Doh. Thread-safe, user-friendly locale flexibility.

20090531 smbolton

* Fix patchfile load and save to be locale-neutral (thanks to Martin
    Tarenskeen for the bug report.)

20090403 smbolton

* Silently ignore 'sample-rate' method.

* Fixed GtkSpinButton adjustments to avoid page_size warning with
    GTK+ >=2.14.

* configure.ac: added check for ladspa.h, removed some obsolete
    macros.

20080411 smbolton

* Use GtkFileChooserWidget instead of GtkFileSelection. Requires
    GTK+ >= 2.4.0.

* Fixed a bug in the XSynth-DSSI patch import.

20080204 smbolton

* Added extra/COPYING-patches and fixed README and
    src/patch_tables.c to clearly declare patches as being in the
    public domain.

* Added config.h.ac, doc/voice_block_diagram.png, and
    extra/COPYING-patches to Makefile.am EXTRA_DIST.  The first two
    have been inadvertently omitted from previous distributions, and
    the block diagram at least shouldn't have been.

20070418 smbolton

* Added 'FM Wave->LF Sine' and 'Phase Distortion' oscillator types.

* Enhanced the GUI by replacing all the mode selection spinbuttons
    with popup menu buttons.

* Improved the envelope generator code so that already-playing notes
    will respond to parameter changes to envelope segments that have
    not yet begun.

* Added a 75% partial width scaling setting to the PADsynth
    parameters.

* Added a few new patches to the default set, including a
    contribution from Ken Restivo.

* Made several GCC 4 fixes, including more sane inlining.

20060122 smbolton

* Added 'Copy' and 'Paste' buttons for the filters and effect.

* Changed the autotools setup to keep the plugin and GUI libraries
    separate (since the plugin doesn't need liblo and the GUI
    doesn't need FFTW.)

* Added a non-realtime worker thread and 'PADsynth' oscillator type.

20051231 smbolton

* Recreated the wavetables, without the boneheaded bandlimiting
    error that was causing several of the the tables to alias badly
    over portions of their key range.  Added several new waveforms,
    including some missing SQ-80 ones, and the Bristol 'jagged-edged
    ramp'.

* Added the 'Dual Delay' effect.

* Incorporated the 4-pole lowpass filter from amSynth.

* Added a persistent comment field to the patches.

* Updated the default patches, with a number of new native patches
    (including contributions from Nigel Henry and Garett Shulman),
    and redid the K4 interpretations after fixing some bugs in the
    import code. Included in the extra/ directory are the WhySynth
    20051005 default patches, in case anyone needs them for
    backwards compatibility, and 454 new K4 interpretations.

* A new Configuration option, 'Cancel Notes On Program Change',
    controls whether WhySynth will stop any playing notes before it
    performs a program change, which can prevent nasty surprises if
    the previous and new patches are not compatible.  Defaults to
    'On'.

* WhySynth now uses gcc/glibc 'constructor' and 'destructor'
    attributes instead of the deprecated _init() and _fini()
    functions (needed for OS X 10.4 'Tiger').

* WhySynth_gtk no longer echos host-initiated control changes back
    to the host.

* DSSI 'hide' now hides the patch edit window, too.

20051005 smbolton
* First release.

20050710 smbolton
* On this dark and stormy night, Xsynth-DSSI began a series of
    profound and rapid mutations, acquired K4-ish wavetable
    oscillators, and was reborn as WhySynth.
